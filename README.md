# Project Structure

The structure of the "Critch" project follows the standard conventions of Electron applications and utilizes various technologies for different aspects of development. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `resources`: Contains public assets like the application icon.
- `build`: Contains build assets.
- `src`: Contains the project codebase.
    - `main`: Contains the logic of the Electron main process.
        - `index.ts`: Contains the main process code.
        - `handles.ts`: Contains the main process event handlers.
    - `preload`: Contains the preload code, which acts as the intermediary between the main process and the renderer process(es).
    - `renderer`: Contains the frontend of the application, developed using React.js.
        - `src/api`: Contains modules related to communication with the server.
            - `axios`: Contains HTTP requests to the server. Each specific entity has its own requests file (e.g., user.ts, channel.ts, etc.).
            - `query`: Contains Tanstack React Query queries and mutations that utilize the aforementioned HTTP requests and manage the response and caching. Each specific entity has its own requests file.
            - `ws`: Contains the WebSocket class used to handle WebSocket events in a generic way and manage reconnection on failed connections or idle situations.
        - `src/app`: Contains the main app component and the Redux store.
        - `src/assets`: Contains images and stylesheets used in the app.
        - `src/components`: Contains global components used throughout the application (e.g., app icon, divider, modal).
        - `src/features`: Contains the core features of the application. Each feature directory contains feature-specific components organized as follows:

            ```
            features
            |_ _ 	featureName
            			|_ _ 	FeatureName.tsx
            			|_ _ 	SubComponents
            					  |_ _ 	SubComponent1.tsx
            					  |_ _ 	SubComponent2.tsx
            
            ```
            
        - `src/hooks`: Contains custom React hooks.
        - `src/reducers`: Contains Redux reducers.
        - `src/util`: Contains helper methods and validation schemas.
        - `src/views`: Contains views, where each view serves as a container for one or more features.
- Other files in the root directory represent configuration files for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Electron-Vite, Tailwind CSS, and PostCSS.
